# Ruby Jobs Mobile Application

## Contributing
Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/marcelobarreto/ruby-jobs-mobile. This project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration.

### Note
I've made this project to help new Ruby on Raills programmers that have interest on AngularJS/Ionic/Mobile Applications. Here, they can see a little bit how to use and consume third API's.
